## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction

Services should exit when asked to or when a no busines logic related error happens. When this happens, chances are the service is still processing some requests. An immediate exit can disrupt this requests and cause (specially in non-transacting environments like microservices) data inconsistencies.

Rescue-parachute helps to stop the execution in an ordered manner. For example, stopping the web server from receiving new requests, then the database connection and finally closing the process.

## <a name="installing"></a> Installing

```
npm install --save bernard
```

## <a name="usage"></a> Usage

Here you have a illustrative example on how to use it with Express:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const server = app.listen(9000);

const Bernard = require('bernard');
const bernard = new Bernard();
bernard.prepare();

bernard.addTask({
    title: 'Express Server',
    handler: function() {
        return server.close();
    }
});
```

More examples available in `docs/examples` directory.

## <a name="contributing"></a> Contributing and help

### <a name="criticism"></a> Criticism
If you think something could be done better or simply sucks, bring up a issue on the [tracker](https://github.com/fcanela/bernard/issues). Don't be shy. I really love feedback and technical discussions.

### <a name="developing"></a> Developing
Pull requests are welcome (and will make me cry in joy). I would love it to have more tests and make `chorizo` use optional.

Did I already say that I **love** technical discussions? Feel free to open a issue on the [tracker](https://github.com/fcanela/bernard/issues) if you have any doubt.

### <a name="bugs"></a> Bug reports, feature requests and discussion

Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/fcanela/bernard/issues) to report any bugs or file feature requests. In case you found a bug and have no GitHub account, feel free to email me: fcanela.dev at gmail dot com.

## <a name="faq"></a> Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I use it in my project?

Probably not. At least, not yet. I usually follow __semver__ for modules versioning and while it is at 0.x.x you can expect breaking changes.

Also, Bernard is tailor made to work with `chorizo`, an opiniorated logger that we use in several projects. It may not suit your needs.

### Why the hell did you coupled those things? And no test for X case?

Yes, Robert C. Martin would slap me with a large trout for this. The number of things that I could do better in each code line I write haunts me daily. Unfortunately I have limited time resources. Feel free to open a pull request if you see something that could be better.

### Who draw the Saint Bernard?

I borrowed it from Landis Blair blog, which had copyleft license.
